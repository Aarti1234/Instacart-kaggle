# Instacart-kaggle
Recommendation (Personalized) for customers of instacart (XGBoost+Light GBM). 
I have used both xgboost and light gbm. Some feature engineering is also done. Little bit exploratory analysis is done. I have saved both training models in two different pickle file named "save.p" and "save2.p" and have made separate prediction file "instacart_pickle.py", one can run directly prediction file (take care for all dependencies needed while running prediction file). 
I want to specially thanks paulantoine.
